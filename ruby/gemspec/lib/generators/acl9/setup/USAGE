Description:
    Installs the basic framework for Acl9. Creates the necessary migration for
    your new roles table and the join table for associating roles with users.

    The optional arguments are as follows:

        subject:  if you want something other than 'User'
        role:     if you want something other than 'Role'
        objects:  space separated list of class names of objects that you can
                  attach roles to (see the docs)

Examples:
    `rails g acl9:setup`

        This will create:
            Migration:      db/migrate/XXX_create_role_tables.rb
            Role Model:     app/models/role.rb
            Config:         config/initializers/acl9.rb

        And it will update (or create a skeleton):
            Subject Model:  app/models/user.rb

    `rails g acl9:setup account permission school classroom department`

        This will create:
            Migration:      db/migrate/XXX_create_permission_tables.rb
            Role Model:     app/models/permission.rb
            Config:         config/initializers/acl9.rb

        And it will update (or create a skeleton):
            Subject Model:  app/models/account.rb
            Object Models:  app/models/school.rb
                            app/models/classroom.rb
                            app/models/department.rb
